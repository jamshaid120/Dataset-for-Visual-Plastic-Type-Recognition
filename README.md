# 🧠 Plastic Type Classification Dataset (3,000+ Images)

This dataset is designed for computer vision and image classification tasks aimed at identifying plastic types from real-world images. It serves as a foundational resource for projects in automated recycling, sustainability, and waste classification.

---

## 📌 Context & Purpose

Plastic pollution is a critical environmental issue. Identifying different plastic types using AI can greatly improve sorting, recycling, and awareness efforts.

This dataset was created:

- To train image classification models that recognize various plastic types  
- To raise public awareness around common plastics and their recyclability  
- As a baseline for building AI-driven sustainability solutions

## 🔍 Data Collection

**Sources:**
- Open image repositories (e.g., Unsplash)
- Web scraping tools (BeautifulSoup4, Selenium)
- Keyword-based image retrieval for relevant plastic items

**Organization:**
- Manually categorized into plastic type folders

> ⚠️ *Note: This dataset is uncleaned and unbalanced. You may need to preprocess it before use.*
